# How it works? What are the features?

### [v2.0.0]
    - The code uses a new library for detecting messages to prevent errors (as in the past lib)
    
    - Within 1-5 seconds (for anti-detecting) the token is passed into Binance API. 

    - Custom configuration for Maximum Hour Requests in source/config.py

    - The console gives information about found crypto-tokens, and 
    if they are valid -> it give information it's about currency, amount and converts it to USDT.

    - If there is a timeout, the programm will CORRECTLY pause all the proccesses.

    - Better logging (removed logger lib), and more information about it. 

# How to create an EXE file from python code?
`1.` If you want to compile with console, run the `build-exe/CONSOLE.bat`  
`2.` If you want to compile WITHOUGHT console, run `build-exe/NO_CONSOLE.bat`

**NOTE: Cookies, and other configurations should be done in code, before running pyinstaller!**
